User Management System - Personal Project

Overview
This is my personalized fork of the User Management System project originally created by Professor Keith Williams for NJIT. It is a secure and scalable API built with FastAPI for managing users with features like authentication, role-based access control, and email verification.

What I Did
Successfully set up the project and deployed it using Docker

Applied database migrations with Alembic

Tested core features like registration, login, user CRUD, and role restrictions

Identified and resolved 5 QA issues documented in GitHub issues

Added 10 new tests covering edge cases and critical paths

Implemented a new feature: [describe your chosen feature briefly here]

Maintained a clean and working development branch deployed to DockerHub

How to Run
Clone this repository

Ensure Docker and Docker Compose are installed

Run docker-compose up --build to start the app and services

Access the API at http://localhost:8000

Use API docs at http://localhost:8000/docs for testing endpoints
